	* src/net/irc/cmd/AbstractIrcCommand.java:
	  fixed bug with colon in commands
	* src:
	  replaced a bunch of things with equivalents in lawu library, but a rewrite
	  of much of the bot would not be unwelcome

	* lib/lawu-0.0.2.jar:
	  added to replace iterator usage, and hopefully other things in the near
	  future
	* src:
	  changed a number of source files in light of the move to new iterators
	* melisma.properties, build.xml, src/net/irc/bot/cmd/Version.java:
	  some changes to build process, bumped project version to 0.2.1
